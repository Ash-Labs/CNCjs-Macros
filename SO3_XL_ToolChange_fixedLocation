;This macro allows you to use a fixed machine location for a tool change/probe. Ideal when you're workpiece surface has been carved away.

; Wait until the planner queue is empty
%wait
; Set user-defined variables
%SAFE_HEIGHT = -5	;clear everything height (negative number, distance below Z limit)
;Following set probe location
%TOOL_PROBE_X = -30	;machine coordinates
%TOOL_PROBE_Y = -350	;machine coordinates
%TOOL_PROBE_Z = -20	;machine coordinates --> lower this (more negative) to start the probing closer to wasteboard

%PROBE_DISTANCE = 100
%PROBE_FEEDRATE = 75
%RETRACTION_DISTANCE = 10
